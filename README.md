# java8-cardFightGame-multiclient-server

This is the multiclient server implmentation for my previous repo https://github.com/smettu007/java8-cardFight-gameInterface,
as it only has game interface implementation.

This can handle multiple sessions with server logs etc. Feel free to use this in your projects.
